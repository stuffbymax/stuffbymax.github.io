## Hello!

My name is **Martin Petik**, and I live in Halifax, United Kingdom. I have a deep passion for programming, website development, and working on translation projects. In my spare time, I love customizing my desktop environment, watching films, creating games, running, and indulging in video games.  

I am a driven individual with a strong interest in computer systems, Linux installations, cybersecurity, and programming. Currently, I am studying **Digital Support Services**, focusing on network security and technical tools. I am known for my problem-solving abilities, creativity, and hands-on approach. I'm excited to apply my skills to real-world projects and collaborate with tech-driven teams.
